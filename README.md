# heart_disease

# Overview
I wrote this program to gain an understanding of how to analyze
datasets by using Python Pandas. This is a very commonly used package
when it comes to data analyses and my overall goal is to broaden my knowledge and skillset in writing software.

Using Python Pandas, the program I've written analyzes some of the factors that predict the likelihood of someone to contract heart disease.

The dataset used in this program can be found here: [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishidamarla/heart-disease-prediction)
